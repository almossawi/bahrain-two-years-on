				<p>Bahrain is a small island with a population of 1.2 million. Unlike most of its neighbors, Bahrain's history is one of pearl diving.  Assyrian inscriptions from 2000 B.C. mentioned Bahrain's pearls, which were a gem so unique to the island that they lured the likes of Jacques Cartier [1].</p>
				<p>For over a century, Bahrain has been the scene of conflict at the approximate rate of once every ten years [2].  The civil unrest has centered around such issues as civil liberties and political freedom.  In 1921, while Bahrain was still a British protectorate, Major A. P. Trevor wrote to the government of India about the country's exploding civil situation [3].  Later accounts by Sir Charles Belgrave told of similar unrest [4].  The current conflict began on February 14, 2011 and has so far resulted in the deaths of 109 civilians including eight expatriates, three police officers and 20 unborn babies [5][6][7][8][9].  As a percentage of total citizens, Bahrain has one of the highest death rates of the uprisings that have become known as the  <i>Arab Spring</i>.</p>
				<p>This visualization depicts the 109 documented deaths of individuals one day or older, as reported by human rights organizations, the independent commission of inquiry and the government, abstracted to take the form of a palm tree.  Mouse-over or press the play button for more details.  Unless noted otherwise, the causes of death are from [9], either verbatim or paraphrased.</p>
				
				<p style="font-size:24px;margin-bottom:0">Causes of death</p>
				<p style="margin-top:0">The top cause of death is tear gas inhalation.  40% of all deaths are a result of direct inhalation of tear gas or complications arising from it.  Several videos on YouTube, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK3mVoQJGJw">such as this one</a>, appear to show police officers firing into homes.  The second highest cause of death is birdshot shells, which police officers typically use against protestors.  15% of deaths are attributed to injuries sustained as a result of being fired on by such shells.  11% of all deaths are caused by live ammunition, rubber bullets and tear gas canisters fired at individuals.  17% of deaths are attributed to physical abuse or torture while in custody.</p>

				<p style="font-size:24px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:55px">Deaths over time</p>
				<p style="margin-top:0">The most number of deaths in a single day occurred on March 16, 2011.  A nationwide crackdown claimed six lives and left hundreds or more injured.  The second most number of deaths had occurred about a month earlier on February 17, 2011 on what became known as Bloody Thursday during an early morning raid on Pearl Roundabout, where approximately 10,000 protestors were camped [14].  Four protestors died and 300 were injured as a result.</p>
