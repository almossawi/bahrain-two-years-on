				<p>Bahrain is a small island in the Persian Gulf with a population of 1.2 million. Bahrain's history and heritage, unlike that of neighboring countries, is one of tourism and pearl diving.  Assyrian inscriptions from 2000 B.C. mentioned Bahrain's pearls, which were a gem so unique to the island that they lured the likes of Jacques Cartier [6].</p>
				<p>For over a century, Bahrain has been the scene of conflict at the approximate rate of once every ten years [4].  The civil unrest has centered around such issues as civil liberties and political freedom.  In 1921, while Bahrain was still a British protectorate, Major A. P. Trevor wrote to the government of India about the country's exploding civil situation and string of kidnappings inflicted on the local people [5].  The current conflict began on February 14, 2011 and has so far resulted in the deaths of 98 civilians, three police officers and 20 unborn babies [1][2][3].  Controlling for population, Bahrain has the highest death rate among all the uprisings that have become known as the  <i>Arab Spring</i>.</p>
